## Challenge:

### 1. Build out the weather component so that it can handle multiple states
### 2. Using the provided API (or any other) make a call to get the data you need to populate your component (extra points for displaying multiple components for different city/states)
### 3. Render your weather compoent with the data recived by the weather api.

### Stretch: Add an input field that allows a user to choose the city/state they want to get weather from.

## Progress, Help, and Completion
### As you build your component drop screenshots into Discord! Its always fun to see where everyone is at. If you need help, drop a question in the #Component-Challenge channel. When you're done, go grab someone and run through your code - it will be a great way to get input on how you could optimize the component or help the other person see how you solved particualr problems.

# Best of Luck!
